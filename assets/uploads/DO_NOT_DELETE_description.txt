<p>The <strong>NRCP</strong> <strong>Research Journal</strong> is the official journal of the National Research Council of the Philippines. All articles published in this journal are refereed and evaluated by the Editorial Board and external referees on over-all quality and correctness, originality, clarity of presentation and contribution to scientific knowledge. As before, the journal will publish scientific papers produced from research projects funded by NRCP. However, we now also welcome submissions of research articles and excellent survey papers from the general public. Topics of papers submitted may come from any of the fields represented by the Divisions of the NRCP.</p>
