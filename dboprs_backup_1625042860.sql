Thus, the author(s) should strongly JUSTIFY the NOVELTY of this research study.

Some strains of Escherichia coli do not produce greenish metallic sheen in EMBA. These strains are considered as atypical E. coli species. Thus, it is imperative to confirm via IMViC Test the isolated bacterial colonies (without greenish metallic sheen) to further confirm the presence or absence of E. coli. The author(s) didn\'t include this method in the confirmatory part of the detection.

The topic of the paper is fascinating, as there are very few baseline studies on sediment microbes in the Philippines. However, the paper reads more like a technical project report presenting very preliminary data and there are some major issues that need to be addressed.

Major comments

1. The rationale and objectives of the study is not clearly presented. What is the working hypothesis? 
2. The choice of methods is not well-justified. Why use a culture-based method when it is known that most bacteria are not culturable? Why sample at the selected sites and during the selected months? 
3. Complete and actual data on colony counts, statistical analyses, and morphological observations are not presented.
4. The study appears to have been conducted without replication. Thus, any conclusions drawn from the results are unfounded.
5. Attribution of observations to certain factors, such as mixing or temperature, are not supported by published data.


Specific comments

Introduction

The output of this project is certainly going to be an important contribution for Lake Lanao protection or conservation efforts. However, the objectives and significance of the study are not clearly presented. What did this study want to determine? What was their working hypothesis? The answers to these questions will determine whether the method used was appropriate.

There needs to be more background information on sediment microbes and why bacterial decomposers are important members of lake ecosystems, such as Lake Lanao. There are many publications in primary scientific literature that the authors can draw upon, even if these are studies that have been conducted on sediments from other lakes.

Methodology

What was the rationale for selecting the sampling sites and time points?

It is not clear from the methods or from Figure 1 where exactly the samples were collected. Was this a 25m transect from the shore? How far from the water line did you start? How deep was each sampling station?

Sample replication and/or subsampling was not stated clearly in the methods. Was there only one biological replicate per station? If yes, were they subsampled during spread plating to serve as technical replicates?

The authors note that they used ‘conventional standard methods’ for characterizing the colonies. This data should be presented clearly in a table or graph, including how may colonies were examined and how many present each morphological feature. Moreover, additional standard biochemical tests should be conducted to better characterize bacterial isolates.

Include information on environmental parameters at each collection site and sampling time point or refer to previous studies that have this data.

Conventional standard methods, formulas, and statistics used in the study should be attributed to appropriate references (i.e. published papers).

Results and Discussion

It is not clear how the statistical analysis was conducted as the output of MANOVA and post hoc analysis is not shown and is not referred to in the results section. 

Most bacterial groups are still unculturable. Thus, it is inaccurate to claim that abundance of bacteria is greater at one site compared to another solely based on culture counts without clear replicates. Authors should qualify their statement by saying that more culturable bacteria were observed in sediments from one site versus another.

Statements attributing differences in CFU to events that may occur at particular months should be supported by appropriate references. Has anyone actually determined that mixing in the lake occurs in January and not at some other time of the year? Is March the warmest month at the lake? Where is the data showing that it rained in June 2016? Was there no rain during the other months?

High bacterial count cannot be correlated to high coliform count and presence of fecal pollution and pathogens because there was no further analysis done to characterize if the bacterial populations observed were indeed coliforms. Further characterization may involve use of differential and selective media, and some biochemical tests (catalase, indole, MR-VP, etc.).

Authors should quantify the results of their morphological observations and present it in the paper.

Results should be discussed in comparison to similar published studies.

Conclusions

“This study shows that bacterial populations were greatly influenced by the changes in physico-chemical profile of an otherwise stable lake ecosystem.” – This is not supported as the authors did not show or cite any physicochemical data.

“The conventional culture method used in this study limits growth and inventory of not even half of the actual populations of bacteria in a lake ecosystem.” – Given that the authors are aware of the limitations of their chosen method, they should better justify the way that they conducted their study and to be explicit about these limitations when interpreting the data.
